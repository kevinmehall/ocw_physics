electron can only exist in well-defined energy levels

 <math> E=hf </math>
 
 <math>E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}</math>

emission spectrum

 <math>\lambda = \frac{h}{p}</math>

**Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** - the very concept of exact position of an object and its exact momentum together have no meaning in nature

 <math>\Delta p \Delta x > h/2\pi = \hbar = 10^-34 J sec </math>
