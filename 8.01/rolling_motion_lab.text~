### Aim

Determine the factors that affect the acceleration with which an object rolls down a slope


### Hypothesis

Objects with mass distributed towards the center will accelerate faster. 

### Background info

Pure Roll is when an object does not skid or slip. For the purposes of this lab,
the objects will be assumed to be in pure roll. The angle is relatively low,
so objects are unlikely to skid. 

In pure roll, because the entire circumference of the object touches the slope in 
one rotation, center of mass has moved <math>2 \pi R</math>. Therefore, <math>v_{cm} = \omega R</math>
where <math>\omega</math> is the angular velocity. Thus, taking the first derivative
with respect to time,  <math>a_{cm} = \dot{\omega} R = \alpha R</math> <sup>(1)</sup>.

The normal force of the slope goes through the center of mass, so it does not cause a torque on the object. The only torque
is caused by the force of friction on the outside of the object. This acts one
radius away from the center point <math>q</math>, so <math>\tau = RF_{friction}</math><sup>(3)</sup>.

 <math>\tau = I_q \alpha</math> <sup>(3)</sup>. Solving (1) for <math>\alpha</math> and
substituting into (2) and (3) gives <math>\tau = RF_{friction} = \frac{I_q a}{R}</math> <sup>(4)</sup>.

Neglecting the rolling motion, the object would experience force 
 <math>F = Ma = Mg \sin \theta - F_{friction}</math> <sup>(5)</sup>.

Solve (4) for <math>F_{friction}</math> and substitute into (5):  
 <math>Ma = Mg \sin \theta - \frac{I_q a}{R^2}</math>

Solving for <math>a</math> yields:
 <math>a = \frac {MR^2 g \sin \theta}{MR^2 + I_q}</math>

The moment of inertia <math>I_q</math> depends on the shape of the object:

  * Hollow Cylinder: <math>I_q = MR^2</math>
  * Solid Cylinder: <math>I_q = \frac12 MR^2</math>
  * Solid Sphere: <math>I_q = \frac25 MR^2</math>
  * Hollow Sphere: <math>I_q = \frac23 MR^2</math>
  
Note that for each of these shapes, <math>\frac{I_q}{MR^2}</math> is a constant.

Thus <math>a = \frac {MR^2 g \sin \theta}{MR^2 + kMR^2}</math>  
 <math> = \frac {MR^2 g \sin \theta}{(1+k)MR^2}</math>  
 <math> = \frac {g \sin \theta}{(1+k)}</math>
 
The acceleration does not depend on the mass or radius of the object, only on the slope,
gravitational acceleration, and mass distribution.

### Variables
 
 * **Acceleration**  - dependent variable  
     (measured by time to go 1m and <math>d = \frac12 a t^2 \rightarrow a = \frac{2d}{t^2})</math>
     
 * **Mass / Weight Distribution / Radius / Moment of Inertia** -  
     independent variable - different for the various objects tested
     
 * **Slope** - held constant at 6.6&deg;
 
 * **Gravitational acceleration** - constant
 
### Procedure

1. Set up a slope and measure its angle
2. Mark a 1 meter distance on the slope
3. Place an object on the upper line, and time its roll to the lower line
4. Repeat step 3 several times and average the results
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each object to be tested

I timed the objects' roll by recording video of the track, and using the frame numbers of when
I let go to when the object crossed the second line to determine the time. This method turned out
to be extremely precise, with most tests varying only one frame or two from other trials of the same object, for 
an error of 0.06 seconds.

This graph shows that there is no significant relationship between radius and
rolling acceleration.

This graph shows that acceleration is similar for objects with similar shapes,
and that for the most part, it follows the predicted values.


### Conclusion

This experiment supports the hypothesis that the acceleration of an object
rolling down a slope depends on the distribution of mass as measured by 
<math>\frac{I}{MR^2}</math>. The objects of the same shape have similar
acceleration. Objects with the mass distributed more centrally around the axis
of rotation accelerate faster, while those with the mass away from the center
accelerate more slowly.

This was especially evident for the cylinders, both hollow and solid. They had
all data points match the predicted acceleration well within the uncertainty.

The spherical objects matched the predicted values less closely. All of the solid
balls accelerated more quickly than predicted. For the marbles and metal balls,
they may have slid, meaning they were not in pure roll and went faster. These objects
have a low coefficient of friction, so they may tend to slide a little. The solid rubber ball
had a slight bounce component to its motion, which may have increased its acceleration
by reducing contact with the slope. For the hollow balls, one source of error may
be that the moment of inertia may not match the predicted values. The equation above for
moment of inertia for a hollow sphere assumes that the entire mass is at the outside of the ball.
Physical hollow spheres have thickness, meaning that the mass is more towards the center
and they accelerate faster. The balls used in this experiment have significant thickness
which may have caused the observed acceleration. This also applies to the hollow
cylinders, but they were thinner and lighter, and this effect was not significant.

The experiment also does not take into account rolling friction. In most cases, this
should be negligible, but in some (tennis ball), it may be significant.

Overall, the methods used in this lab were successful. Timing the trials using
video recording yielded extremely precise results, with trials varying only
one or two frames, and often not varying at all.

One extension would be to repeat the tests at multiple angles, both to verify
the equation for a different <math>\theta</math> and because a lower angle might
reduce the sliding seen with the marbles.
