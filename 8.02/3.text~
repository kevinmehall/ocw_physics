<m>d\Phi = \vec{E} \cdot \hat{n} dA = \vec{e} dA cos \theta</m>

##### Closed Surface

*Sphere:
	<m>\Phi = 4 \pi R^2 E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}</m>

*Gauss's Law:
	<m>\Phi = \oint \vec{E}. \vec{dA} = \frac{\sum Q_{inside}}{\epsilon_0}</m>

*Sphere of radius R with charge Q uniformly distributed at surface:
	*Symmetry Argument 1:
		all points at a given radius <m>r</m> must have equal field
	*Symmetry Argument 2:
		field must point radially outward or inward, so angle is 0 or 180


	*At points <m>r\lt R</m>:
		<m>4 \pi R^2 E = \frac{Q_{inside}}{\epsilon_0}</m>
		<m>Q_{inside}</m> is 0, so <m>E=0</m>
			no electric field inside charged sphere
	*At points <m>r>R</m>:
		<m>4 \pi R^2 E = \frac{Q_{inside}}{\epsilon_0}</m>
		<m>Q_{inside} = Q</m>, so <m>E = \frac{Q}{4\pi r^2 \epsilon_0}</m>
			from the outside, a charged sphere acts the same as if all charge were at center

*Flat Horizontal Plane of infinite size:
	*Charge density
		<m>= \sigma = \frac{Q}{A}</m> (<m>\frac{C}{m^2}</m>)
	Find electric field at point height d
	*Use for Gauss surface:
		Cylinder with top and bottom parallel to plane, with top surface distance d above plane and bottom surface d below plane
		No flux goes through sides of cylinder
		
	<m>E = \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0}</m>
		Electric field does not fall off with distance
		
*Two oppositely charged planes separated by distance <m>d</m>
	Top plate has charge <m>+\sigma</m>, bottom <m>-\sigma</m>
	Field above and below are 0, inside <m>E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}</m>
