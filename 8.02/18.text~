Consider a capacitor:
<m>E = \frac{\sigma_{free}}{\kappa \epsilon_0} = \frac{Q_{free}}{\pi R^2 \kappa \epsilon_0}</m>
<m>I = \frac{dQ_{free}}{dt}</m>
<m>\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{I}{\pi R^2 \kappa \epsilon_0}</m>
In wire outside of capacitor
	<m>B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r}</m>
But inside of capacitor, or using surface that passes between capacitor plates
	Current = 0 so magnetic field = 0 ?!?!
-> Ampere's law inadequate
In between capacitor plates, there is changing magnetic field
magnetic flux = <m>\Phi_E = \int{E dA}</m>
Amended Ampere's law: <m>\oint B dl = \mu_0 \left( I + \epsilon_0 \kappa \frac{d}{dt} \int  E. dA \right)</m>
Added <m>\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \kappa \Phi_E</m> term is called displacement current
	in the presence of dielectric (in capacitor), changing electric field will cause a current inside
	but in the vacuum, there is none
		Maxwell thought a vacuum is a very special dielectric with <m>\kappa = 1</m>, but isn't technically true
Displacement current predicts radio waves
	



If multiple coils spin in B field at different angles, the AC current will be offset
If 3-phase power drives 3 coils offset by 120&deg; (x 2 sides) the magnetic field inside will turn with the same frequency as the AC current
	magnet inside will follow - synchronous motor
	induction motor
		conducting object inside will have eddy current that causes torque
