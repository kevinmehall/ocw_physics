drift velocity = <m>v_d = \frac{eE}{m_e} \tau</m>
	<m>\tau</m> = time between collisions (due to thermal motion)
	<m>n = number of free electrons per cubic meters</m>
	
	about .5 cm/hr in copper at 10V
	
<m>I = v_d A n e = \frac{e^2 n \tau}{m_e} A E</m>

Conductivity = <m>\sigma = \frac{e^2 n \tau}{m_e}</m>
	<m>\sigma_{Cu} \approx 10^8</m>
	<m>\sigma_{glass} \approx 10^-12</m>
	strong function of temperature -> hotter = higher resistance
	
<m>V = \frac{l}{\sigma A}I</m>
Resistivity = <m>\rho = \frac1{\sigma}</m>
Resistance = <m>R = \frac{l}{\sigma A} = l \rho</m>
<m>V = IR</m>

Ohm's law doesn't hold when current causes temperature change (thus changing resistance)

Adding ions to air or water increases its conductivity

Shoes have a resistance of about 4 billion ohms, but is still too high to prevent discharge of static electricity (high voltage, low charge).
