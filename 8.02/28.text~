Energy density
	electric: <m>U_E = \frac12 \epsilon_0 E^2</m>
	magnetic: <m>U_B = \frac1{2\mu_0} B^2</m>
	[J m^-3]
	
	Energy density in the magnetic field of a travelling wave is the same as the energy density of the electric field
	
	<m>U_total = \epsilon_0 E^2 = \epsilon_0 E B c</m>
	
	Energy flux
		<m>U_tot c = \epsilon_0 E B c^2 = \frac{EB}{\mu_0}</m> [J m-^2 sec]
		
		Poynting vector
			<m>\vec{S} = \frac{E \times B}{\mu_0}</m>
			E and B are always perpendicular, so cross product is unnecessary, but predicts direction of wave's travel (direction of S)
			
			Time average <m>\bar{S} = \frac12 \frac{E_0 B_0}{\mu_0}	= \frac12 \frac{E_0^2}{\mu_0 c}</m>
